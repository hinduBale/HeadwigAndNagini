# Vaarta: A Realtime Chat Application

![A snippet of the Vaarta Chat Application](https://github.com/hinduBale/hinduBale.github.io/blob/master/vaarta.PNG)

* Created using the MERN stack. Well, there is no database used here, so you can call it the ERN stack maybe :P
* At the **JOIN** Page, you are expected to type in any **username**(that you like) and type in any random string as your **Room Name**
* Share the **Room Name** so others can join the room and chat :D
* *Fair Warning:* It is deployed on the free tier of *Heroku*, so don't expect it to be fast :(
* You can check out the project [here](https://vaarta.netlify.app/#/) 
* The source code is available [here](https://github.com/hinduBale/HeadwigAndNagini)
